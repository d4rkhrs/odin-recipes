    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Light up your kitchen during the holidays with this &quot;jewel&quot; of a cookie! The buttery shortbread is made in a mini muffin pan, and they're filled with the fruit preserve of your choice.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup plus 1½ tablespoons salted butter, softened (such as Kirkland grass-fed salted butter)</li>
        <li>1⅔ cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup jam or jelly of choice (such as raspberry, strawberry, or apricot)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer or use a stand mixer. Add powdered sugar and beat on low until a crumbly, sandy mixture forms. Gradually add salt and flour, 1 cup at a time, while mixing on low speed. The dough may look extremely dry and crumbly at this point.</li>
        <li>Mix in eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla initially using the mixer, then finishing with your hands to create a smooth, soft, and pliable dough, incorporating all the flour at the bottom of the bowl. Gather dough into a ball and refrigerate in a covered container for about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees F). Adjust the oven racks to the 2 middle rungs. Line 2 mini muffin tins with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Using a small (1 ½ tablespoons) cookie scoop, measure out portions of the dough and set into the prepared muffin cups. Gently roll each dough portions into a smooth ball between your hands and place back into the muffins cups. Push a deep well into each ball using the wooden handle of a spatula or your finger. Fill wells with jam using a small spoon or a piping bag.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until the tops of the cookies look dry, but not browned, 13 to 15 minutes, swapping the trays halfway through.(Or bake one at a time).</li>
        <li>Remove trays from the oven and transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.</li>
    </ol>
